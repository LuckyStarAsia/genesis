- #### Proposed AtomOne Roadmap Discussion
  - After the security updates, the conversation steered into reviewing the [proposed AtomOne Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IngHTASov5E8qEJfRY1ONYuBtOcC7a2vDGVfTG2KjK8/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Phase -2: Talks about preparation of the mainnet, drafting documents, the Constitution 
  - Phase -1: The final point of Phase -1 is to complete the burn mechanism between atone and Photon, simplifying the process so that Photon is obtained by burning atone. The number of Photons, capped at 1 billion, will be exchangeable based on the atone supply.
  - Phase 0: The actual launching of the chain with minimal changes to the existing design, disabling ICS and IBC functionalities. Conversation noted significance in ratifying all governance documents and ensuring transparency in storing the Constitution, laws, and charters.
  - Phase 1: In Phase 1, the focus is on implementing governance improvements, Photonâ€™s utility, IBC improvements, and security measures. The burn mechanism from Atone to Photon will be enabled, with Photon being the fee token for transactions. The activation of the DAOs, ensuring transparency and clear processes, will also take place.
  - Phase 2: Phase 2 will address ICS mechanics and incentives to fix the low Nakamoto coefficient, possibly by tuning rewards based on validator dominance. A grant program will be introduced for community participation. Additionally, there will be the creation of other treasury DAOs.
  - The roadmap, designed to bring stability and confidence to the steps needed is subject to change based on project needs. Community involvement and feedback are encouraged to ensure the roadmap reflects collective goals. The draft of the proposed Constitution will be shared soon, providing comprehensive details about the project's elements and their relationships.
  - Participants were reminded to follow updates on Twitter and Discord, and to provide feedback on the roadmap once posted. The community was assured that adequate time would be given for review, considering vacation periods.
  - The meeting concluded with thanks for the time and participation, expressing anticipation for the next town hall to potentially discuss the Constitution.
